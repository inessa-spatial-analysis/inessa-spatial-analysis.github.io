## Geo analytics and modelling in Python

I have developed my own course Geoanalytics in Python (in Russian) that I have been teaching since 2022. Recently, I started to transform it to fully online course with my support available on Telegram

Currently, the first course **Geo analytics foundations in Python** is available. [Link]([https://geopython.su/])

Other courses "Spatial modelling in Python" and "GeoML" are being under development.
