### About
I’m a Spatial Data Scientist working with geospatial modeling, mobility data, and urban analytics. 

Since 2019, I’ve been helping businesses and cities make better location-based decisions — from FTTH design and retail expansion to improving urban planning and understanding residents’ behaviour.

I teach spatial analysis and modeling in Python in Russian

I’m also a PhD researcher studying remote work and its impact on the urban economy.

## 🗺️ Project 1: Retail Catchment Analysis
**The Challenge:** A retail client needed to identify the optimal location for a new store in Berlin to maximize foot traffic.

**The Solution:**
* Processed 500k+ rows of movement data using Python (Pandas).
* Created isochrones (drive-time zones) using QGIS.
* Scored locations based on demographic density.

**The Result:** The selected location outperformed revenue projections by 12%.
