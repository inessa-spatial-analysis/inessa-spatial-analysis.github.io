# Urban Researches

## REAL ESTATE

### 🏙️ UK Digital Planning & Open Data (collaboration with Novaya Labs)
**Client:** Greater London Authority   
**Challenge:** How can a Local Authority ensure that a development project will proceed when planning for new infrastructure? What type of data can one use for that? What does data quality mean when building Machine Learning models in this context?


**Solution:**
* Investigated 30+ Datasets for 5 London Boroughs to identify which factors and related datasets can be robust indicators for development going ahead. 
* Agregated many datasource into one dashboard and performed descriptive analysis
* Run Weighted Regression to evaulate impact of CIL on planning success development

### 🇬🇧 Property Development Success (Research project at University of Glasgow)
* **Client:** Lumiere Property, London.
* **Challenge**
Understanding the specific factors that drive planning approval decisions in the London Borough of Bromley. The goal was to transform opaque administrative records into actionable insights on what makes a proposal successful.

**Solution**   
* **Data Digitization:** Aggregated and digitized historical planning applications and decision notices from unstructured council records.
* **Spatial Enrichment:** Enhanced the dataset with granular spatial features derived from Open Data, including building proximity, conservation area status, and accessibility metrics.
* **Explainable AI:** Developed Machine Learning models to quantify the specific impact of each spatial factor on the council's decision, providing a transparent view of approval probability.

## PUBLIC PLACES

### Public Space "Foaminess" Analysis (collaboration with Habidatum)
* **Client:** Amsterdam Municipality 
* **Challenge:** Understand what public spaces have local and what have global significance
* **Solution:** Based on labeled by experts list of POIs classify other public places in Amsterdam based on visiting patterns derived from GPS-signals data using Random Forest model

### Tourism Hotspot Identification
* **Client:** Department of Tourism, Moscow.
* **Challenge:** Identify major tourist attractors and spots using mobile operator data.

## PUBLIC TRANSPORT

### Light Rail Performance Analysis in Tel Aviv Metropolitan area (collaboration with NGO 15 min)

**The Challenge**      
To evaluate the efficiency of the new Light Rail Transit (LRT) Red Line. The goal was to quantify the gap between **potential** ridership (based on surrounding density) and **actual** usage, identifying stations that were underperforming due to poor accessibility.

**The Solution**   
* **Catchment Modeling:** Developed a methodology to estimate total potential ridership by aggregating resident and worker populations within the statistical areas surrounding each station.
* **Multi-Modal Access:** Modeled "First Mile/Last Mile" connectivity by calculating walking isochrones and analyzing existing bus feeder capacities.
* **Gap Analysis:** Calculated the "Realization Ratio" (Actual vs. Potential usage) for every station and visualized these gaps on a map to highlight specific locations requiring infrastructure improvements.

## URBAN ECONOMY 

### (PhD Research)
**Topic: The impact of Remote Work on urban equilibrium**

My doctoral research focuses on measuring WFH level at neighborhood level in TelAviv Metropolitan area and estimate its impact on rental prices and consumtion of urban amenities.

* **Focus Area:** Analyzing how hybrid work patterns reshape urban economics and infrastructure needs.
* **Methodology:** Utilizing GPS-singnals data together with Bayesean and spatial econometrics models to understand shifts in city dynamics.
