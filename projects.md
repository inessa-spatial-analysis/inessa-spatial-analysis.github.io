### 🛒 Darkstore Expansion Strategy (Yango Deli)
**Type of business: fast delivery services**

**The Challenge I:** Optimize the current chain of darkstores.

**The Solution:**
* Built an automatically updated **economic growth simulation** model using **Python** that estimate economic effect of one of new scenarios: 1. relocation of current darkstore 2. closing existing darkstore, 3.redraw service zone

**The Challenge II:** suggest new darkstore location for chain expantion in Israel, Russia

**The Solution:**
* Build ML-model that predict potential performance at 200 m resolution over selected cities in Israel and Russia.

**The Challenge III:** assess the potential demand, target geography and chain capacity in UK and South Africa

**The Solution:** 
 - Estimate potential demand in every major city based on their socio-economic profile
 - Project city demand on building level
 - Use Integer Linear Programming Algorithms to find optimal number of darkstores in each city that is trade-off between CAPEX and potential audience coverage

### ⛽ Global Retail Site Selection (Locatium)
**The Challenge:** Select optimal sites for gas stations and retail chains across the UAE and US[cite: 16].

**The Solution:**
* **Modeling:** Developed Geo ML models using **sklearn, PySAL, and GeoPandas**.
* **Data Pipeline:** Created pipelines to clean open data on urban infrastructure, demographics, and POIs using APIs, web-scraping, and **Big Query**.
* **Innovation:** Developed a Python library to predict economic potential at the building level using morphometrics (applied in Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil).

## 🗺️ Project 1: Retail Catchment Analysis
**The Challenge:** A retail client needed to identify the optimal location for a new store in Berlin to maximize foot traffic.

**The Solution:**
* Processed 500k+ rows of movement data using Python (Pandas).
* Created isochrones (drive-time zones) using QGIS.
* Scored locations based on demographic density.

**The Result:** The selected location outperformed revenue projections by 12%.
